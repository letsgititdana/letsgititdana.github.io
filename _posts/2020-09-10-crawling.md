# Web Crawling with Python

(to be updated)



## Solutions When Block

## ed (TimeoutException)

As I was crawling, I caught TimeoutException with "Message: timeout: Timed out receiving message from renderer". 

Here is a list of solutions that I've searched and tried to solve this timeout . (Selenium, Chrome)



1. Set header (User-Agent)

> The server could consider your web crawler as something malicious, as if a hacking bot. So they might want to stop giving you the information you requested anymore. In this case, you can tell them, "I'm not a bot, but a human...I think." You can do this by putting *User-Agent* in *headers*. Here, *header* contains information about you (or your program) who accesses the site. 



Here is my original code.

```python
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=r"your_chromecdriver_path")
```



Here is the new code with User-Agent information added.

```python
chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
chrome_options.add_argument('--user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.83 Safari/537.36"')
driver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=chrome_options, executable_path=r"your_chromedriver_path")
```

You can get your own User-Agent information in this site:  http://www.useragentstring.com/. Just copy and paste the User Agent String, because it contains Chrome already. Or you can search for a specific brower you want by cliking 'List of User Agent Strings'.
